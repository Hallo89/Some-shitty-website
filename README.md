# hallo89.github.io (formerly Some-shitty-website)

An own website having started as a little side-project of mine, without much confidence, as one can see at the former name of it.

Since it has become quite feature-rich and a large playground for my projects, it has been moved to https://github.com/hallo89/hallo89.net, with this repository being archived.
