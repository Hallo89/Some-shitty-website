# hallo89.github.io (formerly Some-shitty-website)

A website having started as a little side-project of mine, without much confidence, as one can see at the name of it.
Meanwhile it is actually quite feature-rich and a large playground for my projects

It features for example a random number generator and an ongoing model creator for Minecraft, but also a page to create triangles and other silly stuff
